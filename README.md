#Fake News Detection

##Overview
This project aims to develop a Fake News Detection system using NLP techniques.It uses BERT for feature extraction and LightGBM for classification. The project combines the power of deep learning with BERT and the efficiency of gradient boosting with LightGBM to accurately classify news article as true or false.
